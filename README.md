# GitHub Actions for deploying to Azure

## Automate your GitHub workflows using Azure Actions

[GitHub Actions](https://help.github.com/en/articles/about-github-actions) gives you the flexibility to build an automated software development lifecycle workflow.

With [GitHub Actions for Azure](https://github.com/Azure/actions/) you can create workflows that you can set up in your repository to build, test, package, release and **deploy** to Azure.

NOTE: you must have write permissions to the repository in question. If you're using a sample repository from Microsoft, be sure to first fork the repository to your own GitHub account.

Get started today with a [free Azure account](https://azure.com/free/open-source).

# GitHub Action for Azure Login

With the Azure login Action, you can automate your workflow to do an Azure login using [Azure service principal](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/develop/app-objects-and-service-principals) and run Azure CLI and Azure PowerShell scripts. You can leverage this action for the public or soverign clouds including Azure Government and Azure Stack Hub (using the `environment` parameter).

By default, the action only logs in with the Azure CLI (using the `az login` command). To log in with the Az PowerShell module, set `enable-AzPSSession` to true. To login to Azure tenants without any subscriptions, set the optional parameter `allow-no-subscriptions` to true.

To login into one of the Azure Government clouds, set the optional parameter environment with supported cloud names AzureUSGovernment or AzureChinaCloud. If this parameter is not specified, it takes the default value AzureCloud and connect to the Azure Public Cloud. Additionally the parameter creds takes the Azure service principal created in the particular cloud to connect (Refer to Configure deployment credentials section below for details).

This repository contains GitHub Action for [Azure Login](https://github.com/Azure/login/blob/master/action.yml).

## Sample workflow that uses Azure login action to run az cli

```yaml

    - uses: azure/login@v1
      with:
        creds: ${{ secrets.AZURE_CREDENTIALS }}

    - run: |
        az webapp list --query "[?state=='Running']"
```

## Sample workflow that uses Azure login action to run Azure PowerShell

```yaml

## Sample to connect to Azure US Government cloud

```
   - name: Login to Azure US Gov Cloud with CLI
     uses: azure/login@v1
        with:
          creds: ${{ secrets.AZURE_US_GOV_CREDENTIALS }}
          environment: 'AzureUSGovernment'
          enable-AzPSSession: false
   - name: Login to Azure US Gov Cloud with Az Powershell
      uses: azure/login@v1
        with:

          environment: 'AzureUSGovernment'
          enable-AzPSSession: true
```

Refer to the [Azure PowerShell](https://github.com/azure/powershell) Github action to run your Azure PowerShell scripts.

## Sample Azure Login workflow that to run az cli on Azure Stack Hub

```yaml

# File: .github/workflows/workflow.yml

on: [push]

name: AzureLoginSample

jobs:

  build-and-deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
    - uses: azure/login@v1
      with:
        creds: ${{ secrets.AZURE_CREDENTIALS }}
        environment: 'AzureStack'

    - run: |
        az webapp list --query "[?state=='Running']"

```
Refer to the [Azure Stack Hub Login Action Tutorial](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure-stack/user/ci-cd-github-action-login-cli?view=azs-2008) for more detailed instructions.

## Configure deployment credentials:

The previous sample workflows depend on a [secrets](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/actions/reference/encrypted-secrets) named `AZURE_CREDENTIALS` in your repository. The value of this secret is expected to be a JSON object that represents a service principal (an identifer for an application or process) that authenticates the workflow with Azure.

To function correctly, this service principal must be assigned the [Contributor]((https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/role-based-access-control/built-in-roles#contributor)) role for the web app or the resource group that contains the web app.

The following steps describe how to create the service principal, assign the role, and create a secret in your repository with the resulting credentials.

1. Open the Azure Cloud Shell at [https://shell.azure.com](https://shell.azure.com). You can alternately use the [Azure CLI](https://docs.microsoft.com/cli/azure/install-azure-cli?view=azure-cli-latest) if you've installed it locally. (For more information on Cloud Shell, see the [Cloud Shell Overview](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/cloud-shell/overview).)

    1.1 **(Required ONLY when environment is Azure Stack Hub)** Run the following command to set the SQL Management endpoint to 'not supported'
      ```bash

      az cloud update -n {environmentName} --endpoint-sql-management https://notsupported

      ```

2. Use the [az ad sp create-for-rbac](https://docs.microsoft.com/cli/azure/ad/sp?view=azure-cli-latest#az_ad_sp_create_for_rbac) command to create a service principal and assign a Contributor role:

    For web apps (also more secure)

    ```azurecli
    az ad sp create-for-rbac --name "{sp-name}" --sdk-auth --role contributor \
        --scopes /subscriptions/{subscription-id}/resourceGroups/{resource-group}/providers/Microsoft.Web/sites/{app-name}
    ```

    For usage with other Azure services (Storage Accounts, Active Directory, etc.)

    ```azurecli
    az ad sp create-for-rbac --name "{sp-name}" --sdk-auth --role contributor \
        --scopes /subscriptions/{subscription-id}/resourceGroups/{resource-group}
    ```

    Replace the following:
      * `{sp-name}` with a suitable name for your service principal, such as the name of the app itself. The name must be unique within your organization.
      * `{subscription-id}` with the subscription ID you want to use (found in Subscriptions in portal)
      * `{resource-group}` the resource group containing the web app.
      * [optional] `{app-name}` if you wish to have a tighter & more secure scope, use the first option and replace this with the name of the web app.

    More info can be found [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/ad/sp?view=azure-cli-latest#az_ad_sp_create_for_rbac).

    This command invokes Azure Active Directory (via the `ad` part of the command) to create a service principal (via `sp`) specifically for [Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/role-based-access-control/overview) (via `create-for-rbac`).

    The `--role` argument specifies the permissions to grant to the service principal at the specified `--scope`. In this case, you grant the built-in [Contributor](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/role-based-access-control/built-in-roles#contributor) role at the scope of the web app in the specified resource group in the specified subscription. If desired, you can omit the part of the scope starting with `/providers/...` to grant the service principal the Contributor role for the entire resource group. For security purposes, however, it's always preferable to grant permissions at the most restrictive scope possible.

3. When complete, the `az ad sp create-for-rbac` command displays JSON output in the following form (which is specified by the `--sdk-auth` argument):

    ```json
    {
      "clientId": "<GUID>",
      "clientSecret": "<GUID>",
      "subscriptionId": "<GUID>",
      "tenantId": "<GUID>",
      (...)
    }
    ```

4. In your repository, use **Add secret** to create a new secret named `AZURE_CREDENTIALS` (as shown in the example workflow), or using whatever name is in your workflow file.

NOTE: While adding secret `AZURE_CREDENTIALS` make sure to add like this 

         {"clientId": "<GUID>",
          "clientSecret": "<GUID>",
          "subscriptionId": "<GUID>",
          "tenantId": "<GUID>",
          (...)}

   instead of  

        {
            "clientId": "<GUID>",
            "clientSecret": "<GUID>",
            "subscriptionId": "<GUID>",
            "tenantId": "<GUID>",
            (...)
        }

   to prevent unnecessary masking of `{ } ` in your logs which are in dictionary form.
     
5. Paste the entire JSON object produced by the `az ad sp create-for-rbac` command as the secret value and save the secret.

NOTE: to manage service principals created with `az ad sp create-for-rbac`, visit the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com), navigate to your Azure Active Directory, then select **Manage** > **App registrations** on the left-hand menu. Your service principal should appear in the list. Select a principal to navigate to its properties. You can also manage role assignments using the [az role assignment](https://docs.microsoft.com/cli/azure/role/assignment?view=azure-cli-latest) command.

NOTE: Currently there is no support for passing in the Subscription ID, Tenant ID, Client ID, and Client Secret as individual parameters instead of bundled in a single JSON object (creds).
However, a simple workaround for users who need this option can be:
```yaml
  - uses: Azure/login@v1.1
    with:
      creds: '{"clientId":"${{ secrets.CLIENT_ID }}","clientSecret":"${{ secrets.CLIENT_SECRET }}","subscriptionId":"${{ secrets.SUBSCRIPTION_ID }}","tenantId":"${{ secrets.TENANT_ID }}"}'
```
In a similar way, any additional parameter can be addded to creds such as resourceManagerEndpointUrl for Azure Stack, for example.
## Support for using `allow-no-subscriptions` flag with az login

Capability has been added to support access to tenants without subscriptions. This can be useful to run tenant level commands, such as `az ad`. The action accepts an optional parameter `allow-no-subscriptions` which is `false` by default.

```yaml
# File: .github/workflows/workflow.yml

on: [push]

name: AzureLoginWithNoSubscriptions

jobs:

  build-and-deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:

    - uses: azure/login@v1
      with:
        creds: ${{ secrets.AZURE_CREDENTIALS }}
        allow-no-subscriptions: true
```
## Az logout and security hardening

This action doesn't implement ```az logout``` by default at the end of execution. However there is no way of tampering the credentials or account information because the github hosted runner is on a VM that will get reimaged for every customer run which gets everything deleted. But if the runner is self-hosted which is not github provided it is recommended to manually logout at the end of the workflow as shown below. More details on security of the runners can be found [here](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/learn-github-actions/security-hardening-for-github-actions#hardening-for-self-hosted-runners).
```
- name: Azure CLI script
  uses: azure/CLI@v1
  with:
    azcliversion: 2.0.72
    inlineScript: |
      az logout
      az cache purge
      az account clear
```
