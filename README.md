With the [Azure Login Action](https://github.com/Azure/login), you can login to Azure and run [Azure CLI](https://learn.microsoft.com/cli/azure/) and [Azure PowerShell](https://learn.microsoft.com/powershell/azure) scripts.

Azure Login Action supports different ways of authentication with Azure.

- Login with OpenID Connect (OIDC)
- Login with a Service Principal Secret
- Login with System-assigned Managed Identity
- Login with User-assigned Managed Identity

**We recommend using OIDC based authentication for increased security.**

> [!WARNING]
> By default, the output of Azure CLI commands is printed to the stdout stream. Without redirecting the stdout stream, contents in it will be stored in the build log of the action. Configure Azure CLI to _not_ show output in the console screen or print in the log by setting the environment variable `AZURE_CORE_OUTPUT` to `none`. If you need the output of a specific command, override the default setting using the argument `--output` with your format of choice. For more information on output options with the Azure CLI, see [Format output](https://learn.microsoft.com/cli/azure/format-output-azure-cli).

** **

> [!WARNING]
> Avoid using managed identity login on self-hosted runners in public repositories. Managed identities enable secure authentication with Azure resources and obtain Microsoft Entra ID tokens without the need for explicit credential management. Any user can open pull requests against your repository and access your self-hosted runners without credentials. See more details in [self-hosted runner security](https://docs.github.com/actions/hosting-your-own-runners/managing-self-hosted-runners/about-self-hosted-runners#self-hosted-runner-security).

### `client-id`

The input parameter `client-id` specifies the login client id. It could be the client id of a service principal or a user-assigned managed identity.

It's used in login with OpenID Connect (OIDC) and user-assigned managed identity.

It's better to create a GitHub Action secret for this parameter when using it. Refer to [Using secrets in GitHub Actions](https://docs.github.com/actions/security-guides/using-secrets-in-github-actions).

Refer to [Login With OpenID Connect (OIDC)](#login-with-openid-connect-oidc-recommended) and [Login With User-assigned Managed Identity](#login-with-user-assigned-managed-identity) for its usage.

### `subscription-id`

The input parameter `subscription-id` specifies the login subscription id.

It's used in login with OpenID Connect (OIDC) and managed identity.

It's better to create a GitHub Action secret for this parameter when using it. Refer to [Using secrets in GitHub Actions](https://docs.github.com/actions/security-guides/using-secrets-in-github-actions).

Refer to [Login With OpenID Connect (OIDC)](#login-with-openid-connect-oidc-recommended), [Login With System-assigned Managed Identity](#login-with-system-assigned-managed-identity) and [Login With User-assigned Managed Identity](#login-with-user-assigned-managed-identity) for its usage.

### `tenant-id`

The input parameter `tenant-id` specifies the login tenant id.

It's used in login with OpenID Connect (OIDC) and managed identity.

It's better to create a GitHub Action secret for this parameter when using it. Refer to [Using secrets in GitHub Actions](https://docs.github.com/actions/security-guides/using-secrets-in-github-actions).

Refer to [Login With OpenID Connect (OIDC)](#login-with-openid-connect-oidc-recommended), [Login With System-assigned Managed Identity](#login-with-system-assigned-managed-identity) and [Login With User-assigned Managed Identity](#login-with-user-assigned-managed-identity) for its usage.

### `creds`

> [!NOTE]
>
> If one of `client-id` and `subscription-id` and `tenant-id` is set, `creds` will be ignored.

The value of input parameter `creds` is a string in json format, including the following values:

```json
{
    "clientSecret":  "******",
    "subscriptionId":  "******",
    "tenantId":  "******",
    "clientId":  "******"
}
```

It's used in login with an Azure service principal.

It's better to create a GitHub Action secret for this parameter when using it. Refer to [Using secrets in GitHub Actions](https://docs.github.com/actions/security-guides/using-secrets-in-github-actions).

Refer to [Login With a Service Principal Secret](#login-with-a-service-principal-secret) for its usage.

### `enable-AzPSSession`

By default, Azure Login Action only logs in with the Azure CLI. To log in with the Azure PowerShell module, set `enable-AzPSSession` to true.

Refer to [Login With OpenID Connect (OIDC)](#login-with-openid-connect-oidc-recommended) for its usage.

### `environment`

By default, Azure Login Action connects to the Azure Public Cloud (`AzureCloud`).

To login to one of the Azure Government clouds or Azure Stack, set `environment` to one of the supported values `AzureUSGovernment` or `AzureChinaCloud` or `AzureGermanCloud` or `AzureStack`.

Refer to [Login to Azure US Government cloud](#login-to-azure-us-government-cloud) for its usage.

### `allow-no-subscriptions`

By default, Azure Login Action requires a `subscription-id`. To login to Azure tenants without any subscriptions, set `allow-no-subscriptions` to true.

Refer to [Login without subscription](#login-without-subscription) for its usage.

### `audience`

Azure Login Action gets the JWT ID token from GitHub OIDC provider when login with OIDC. The default `audience` is `api://AzureADTokenExchange`. Users can specify a custom `audience`.

### `auth-type`

The input parameter `auth-type` specifies the type of authentication. The default value is `SERVICE_PRINCIPAL`. Users can specify it as `IDENTITY` for login with Managed Identity.

Refer to [Login With System-assigned Managed Identity](#login-with-system-assigned-managed-identity) and [Login With User-assigned Managed Identity](#login-with-user-assigned-managed-identity) for its usage.

## Workflow Examples

### Login With OpenID Connect (OIDC) [Recommended]

> [!NOTE]
>
> - Ensure the CLI version is 2.30 or above to support login with OIDC.
> - By default, Azure access tokens issued during OIDC based login could have limited validity. Azure access token issued by Service Principal is expected to have an expiration of 1 hour by default. And with Managed Identities, it would be 24 hours. This expiration time is further configurable in Azure. Refer to [access-token lifetime](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/develop/access-tokens#access-token-lifetime) for more details.

Before you use Azure Login Action with OIDC, you need to configure a federated identity credential on an service principal or a managed identity.

- Prepare a service principal for Login with OIDC
  - [Create a service principal and assign a role to it](https://learn.microsoft.com/entra/identity-platform/howto-create-service-principal-portal)
  - [Configure a federated identity credential on an service principal](https://learn.microsoft.com/entra/workload-id/workload-identity-federation-create-trust?pivots=identity-wif-apps-methods-azp#github-actions)
- Prepare a user-assigned managed identity for Login with OIDC
  - [Create a user-assigned managed identity and assign a role to it](https://learn.microsoft.com/entra/identity/managed-identities-azure-resources/how-manage-user-assigned-managed-identities?pivots=identity-mi-methods-azp#create-a-user-assigned-managed-identity)
  - [Configure a federated identity credential on a user-assigned managed identity](https://learn.microsoft.com/entra/workload-id/workload-identity-federation-create-trust-user-assigned-managed-identity?pivots=identity-wif-mi-methods-azp#github-actions-deploying-azure-resources)

After it, create GitHub Action secrets for following values: (Refer to [Using secrets in GitHub Actions](https://docs.github.com/actions/security-guides/using-secrets-in-github-actions).)

- AZURE_CLIENT_ID: the service principal client ID or user-assigned managed identity client ID
- AZURE_SUBSCRIPTION_ID: the subscription ID
- AZURE_TENANT_ID: the tenant ID

Now you can try the workflow to login with OIDC.

> [!NOTE]
>
> In GitHub workflow, you should set `permissions:` with `id-token: write` at workflow level or job level based on whether the OIDC token is allowed be generated for all Jobs or a specific Job.

- **The workflow sample to only run Azure CLI**

```yaml
# File: .github/workflows/workflow.yml

name: Run Azure Login with OIDC
on: [push]

permissions:
      id-token: write
      contents: read
jobs: 
  build-and-deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Azure login
        uses: azure/login@v2
        with:
          client-id: ${{ secrets.AZURE_CLIENT_ID }}
          tenant-id: ${{ secrets.AZURE_TENANT_ID }}
          subscription-id: ${{ secrets.AZURE_SUBSCRIPTION_ID }}
  
      - name: Azure CLI script
        uses: azure/CLI@v1
        with:
          azcliversion: latest
          inlineScript: |
            az account show
```

- **The workflow sample to run both Azure CLI and Azure PowerShell**

```yaml
# File: .github/workflows/workflow.yml

name: Run Azure Login with OIDC
on: [push]

permissions:
      id-token: write
      contents: read
jobs: 
  build-and-deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Azure login
        uses: azure/login@v2
        with:
          client-id: ${{ secrets.AZURE_CLIENT_ID }}
          tenant-id: ${{ secrets.AZURE_TENANT_ID }}
          subscription-id: ${{ secrets.AZURE_SUBSCRIPTION_ID }}
          enable-AzPSSession: true
  
      - name: Azure CLI script
        uses: azure/CLI@v1
        with:
          azcliversion: latest
          inlineScript: |
            az account show

      - name: Azure PowerShell script
        uses: azure/powershell@v1
        with:
          azPSVersion: "latest"
          inlineScript: |
            Get-AzContext
```

### Login With a Service Principal Secret

Before you login a service principal secret, you need to prepare a service principal with a secret.

- [Create a service principal and assign a role to it](https://learn.microsoft.com/entra/identity-platform/howto-create-service-principal-portal)
- [Create a new service principal client secret](https://learn.microsoft.com/entra/identity-platform/howto-create-service-principal-portal#option-3-create-a-new-client-secret)

After it, create a GitHub Action secret `AZURE_CREDENTIALS` with the value like below: (Refer to [Using secrets in GitHub Actions](https://docs.github.com/actions/security-guides/using-secrets-in-github-actions).)

```json
{
    "clientSecret":  "******",
    "subscriptionId":  "******",
    "tenantId":  "******",
    "clientId":  "******"
}
```

- clientSecret: the service principal client secret
- subscriptionId: the subscription ID
- tenantId: the tenant ID
- clientId: the service principal client ID

Now you can try the workflow to login with a service principal secret.

- **The workflow sample to only run Azure CLI**

```yaml
# File: .github/workflows/workflow.yml

on: [push]

name: Run Azure Login With a Service Principal Secret

jobs:

  build-and-deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
    
    - uses: azure/login@v2
      with:
        creds: ${{ secrets.AZURE_CREDENTIALS }}
    
    - name: Azure CLI script
      uses: azure/CLI@v1
      with:
        azcliversion: latest
        inlineScript: |
          az account show

```

- **The workflow sample to run both Azure CLI and Azure PowerShell**

```yaml
# File: .github/workflows/workflow.yml

on: [push]

name: Run Azure Login With a Service Principal Secret

jobs:

  build-and-deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
    
    - uses: azure/login@v2
      with:
        creds: ${{ secrets.AZURE_CREDENTIALS }}
        enable-AzPSSession: true
    
    - name: Azure CLI script
      uses: azure/CLI@v1
      with:
        azcliversion: latest
        inlineScript: |
          az account show

    - name: Azure PowerShell script
      uses: azure/powershell@v1
      with:
        azPSVersion: "latest"
        inlineScript: |
          Get-AzWebApp
```

If you want to pass subscription ID, tenant ID, client ID, and client secret as individual parameters instead of bundling them in a single JSON object to address the [security concerns](https://docs.github.com/actions/security-guides/encrypted-secrets), below snippet can help with the same.

```yaml
  - uses: azure/login@v2
    with:
      creds: '{"clientId":"${{ secrets.AZURE_CLIENT_ID }}","clientSecret":"${{ secrets.AZURE_CLIENT_SECRET }}","subscriptionId":"${{ secrets.AZURE_SUBSCRIPTION_ID }}","tenantId":"${{ secrets.AZURE_TENANT_ID }}"}'
```

### Login With System-assigned Managed Identity

> [!NOTE]

          Get-AzContext
```

## Security hardening

> [!WARNING]
> When using self hosted runners it is possible to have multiple runners on a single VM. Currently if your runners share a single user on the VM each runner will share the same credentials. That means in detail that each runner is able to change the permissions of another run. As a workaround we propose to use one single VM user per runner. If you start the runner as a service, do not forget to add the [optional user argument](https://docs.github.com/actions/hosting-your-own-runners/managing-self-hosted-runners/configuring-the-self-hosted-runner-application-as-a-service#installing-the-service)

## Azure CLI dependency

Internally in this action, we use azure CLI and execute `az login` with the credentials provided through secrets. In order to validate the new azure CLI releases for this action, [canary test workflow](.github/workflows/azure-login-canary.yml) is written which will execute the action on [azure CLI's edge build](https://github.com/Azure/azure-cli#edge-builds) which will fail incase of any breaking change is being introduced in the new upcoming release. The test results can be posted on a slack or teams channel using the corresponding integrations. Incase of a failure, the concern will be raised to [azure-cli](https://github.com/Azure/azure-cli) for taking a necessary action and also the latest CLI installation will be postponed in [Runner VMs](https://github.com/actions/virtual-environments) as well for hosted runner to prevent the workflows failing due to the new CLI changes.
