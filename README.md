# GitHub Actions for deploying to Azure

## Automate your GitHub workflows using Azure Actions

[GitHub Actions](https://help.github.com/en/articles/about-github-actions) gives you the flexibility to build an automated software development lifecycle workflow. 

With [GitHub Actions for Azure](https://github.com/Azure/actions/) you can create workflows that you can set up in your repository to build, test, package, release and **deploy** to Azure.

NOTE: you must have write permissions to the repository in question. If you're using a sample repository from Microsoft, be sure to first fork the repository to your own GitHub account.

Get started today with a [free Azure account](https://azure.com/free/open-source).

# GitHub Action for Azure Login

With the Azure login Action, you can automate your workflow to do an Azure login using [Azure service principal](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/develop/app-objects-and-service-principals) and run Azure CLI and Azure PowerShell scripts.

By default, the action only logs in with the Azure CLI (using the `az login` command). To log in with the Az PowerShell module, set `enable-AzPSSession` to true.

This repository contains GitHub Action for [Azure Login](https://github.com/Azure/login/blob/master/action.yml).

## Sample workflow that uses Azure login action to run az cli

```yaml
# File: .github/workflows/workflow.yml

on: [push]

name: AzureLoginSample

jobs:

  build-and-deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:

    - uses: azure/login@v1
      with:
        creds: ${{ secrets.AZURE_CREDENTIALS }}

    - run: |
        az webapp list --query "[?state=='Running']"
```

## Sample workflow that uses Azure login action to run Azure PowerShell

```yaml
# File: .github/workflows/workflow.yml

on: [push]

name: AzurePowerShellSample

jobs:

  build-and-deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:

    - name: Login via Az module
      uses: azure/login@v1
      with:
        creds: ${{secrets.AZURE_CREDENTIALS}}
        enable-AzPSSession: true 

    - name: Run Az CLI script
      run: |
        az webapp list --query "[?state=='Running']"

    - name: Run Azure PowerShell script
      uses: azure/powershell@v1
      with:
        azPSVersion: '3.1.0'
        inlineScript: |
          Get-AzVM -ResourceGroupName "ActionsDemo"
```

Refer to the [Azure PowerShell](https://github.com/azure/powershell) Github action to run your Azure PowerShell scripts.

## Configure deployment credentials:

The previous sample workflows depend on a [secrets](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/actions/reference/encrypted-secrets) named `AZURE_CREDENTIALS` in your repository. The value of this secret is expected to be a JSON object that represents a service principal (an identifer for an application or process) that authenticates the workflow with Azure.

To function correctly, this service principal must be assigned the [Contributor]((https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/role-based-access-control/built-in-roles#contributor)) role for the web app or the resource group that contains the web app.

The following steps describe how to create the service principal, assign the role, and create a secret in your repository with the resulting credentials.

1. Open the Azure Cloud Shell at [https://shell.azure.com](https://shell.azure.com). You can alternately use the [Azure CLI](https://docs.microsoft.com/cli/azure/install-azure-cli?view=azure-cli-latest) if you've installed it locally. (For more information on Cloud Shell, see the [Cloud Shell Overview](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/cloud-shell/overview).)
  
2. Use the [az ad sp create-for-rbac](https://docs.microsoft.com/cli/azure/ad/sp?view=azure-cli-latest#az_ad_sp_create_for_rbac) command to create a service principal and assign a Contributor role:

    ```azurecli
    az ad sp create-for-rbac --name "{sp-name}" --sdk-auth --role contributor \
        --scopes /subscriptions/{subscription-id}/resourceGroups/{resource-group}/providers/Microsoft.Web/sites/{app-name}
    ```

    Replace the following:
      * `{sp-name}` with a suitable name for your service principal, such as the name of the app itself. The name must be unique within your organization.
      * `{subscription-id}` with the subscription you want to use
      * `{resource-group}` the resource group containing the web app.
      * `{app-name}` with the name of the web app.

    This command invokes Azure Active Directory (via the `ad` part of the command) to create a service principal (via `sp`) specifically for [Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/role-based-access-control/overview) (via `create-for-rbac`).

    The `--role` argument specifies the permissions to grant to the service principal at the specified `--scope`. In this case, you grant the built-in [Contributor](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/role-based-access-control/built-in-roles#contributor) role at the scope of the web app in the specified resource group in the specified subscription.

    If desired, you can omit the part of the scope starting with `/providers/...` to grant the service principal the Contributor role for the entire resource group:

    ```azurecli  
    az ad sp create-for-rbac --name "{sp-name}" --sdk-auth --role contributor \
        --scopes /subscriptions/{subscription-id}/resourceGroups/{resource-group}
    ```

    For security purposes, however, it's always preferable to grant permissions at the most restrictive scope possible.

3. When complete, the `az ad sp create-for-rbac` command displays JSON output in the following form (which is specified by the `--sdk-auth` argument):

    ```json
    {
      "clientId": "<GUID>",
      "clientSecret": "<GUID>",
      "subscriptionId": "<GUID>",
      "tenantId": "<GUID>",
      (...)
    }
    ```

4. In your repository, use **Add secret** to create a new secret named `AZURE_CREDENTIALS` (as shown in the example workflow), or using whatever name is in your workflow file.

5. Paste the entire JSON object produced by the `az ad sp create-for-rbac` command as the secret value and save the secret.

NOTE: to manage service principals created with `az ad sp create-for-rbac`, visit the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com), navigate to your Azure Active Directory, then select **Manage** > **App registrations** on the left-hand menu. Your service principal should appear in the list. Select a principal to navigate to its properties. You can also manage role assignments using the [az role assignment](https://docs.microsoft.com/cli/azure/role/assignment?view=azure-cli-latest) command.
